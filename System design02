Some question examples
  We can give a few examples of such questions:
  Design a URL shortening service like bit.ly.
  How would you implement the Google search?
  Design a client-server application which allows people to play chess with one another.
  How would you store the relations in a social network like Facebook and implement a feature where one user receives notifications when their friends like the same things as they do?

The typical outcome of such a discussion is a high-level architecture addressing the goals and constraints in the question.
  interviewer will want to discuss bottlenecks and other common problems.
